# Art-hive

## Overview 

Art-hive is a family friendly web application for organizing, preserving, and celebrating your child’s artwork. Instead of letting masterpieces pile up or get lost, Art-hive provides a digital “hive” where each child can have their own profile and gallery. Parents can easily upload, view, and manage their children’s creations in a secure, private, and visually engaging environment. The app is designed with accessibility, ease of use, and a playful bee/honey theme to make the experience fun for all ages.
